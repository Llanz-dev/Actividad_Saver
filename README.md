# Actividad_Saver

## Description
Actividad_Saver is a to-do application for you to list all your activity.

- I inspired to make this project because I note all my work for a day in the microsoft note mobile application, so I decided to make my own to-do application.
- I build this project to enhance my capability in Django and to explore it in my own.
- This project can list all your activities and navigate them.
- I learned how to manipulate the database and how to render them.

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap CSS & Icons (5.1)
- Vanilla JavaScript
