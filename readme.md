# Actividad_Saver

## Description
Actividad_Saver is a to-do application for you to list all your activity.

- It can list down all your activity all day in which district of Iloilo, Philippines you will do that. To make it more convenient, there's also a search functionality to help you find that list or activity.
- The Django framework I used for my back-end because it's easy to maintain the whole project and you can build a big project in a fast way. The database is easy to manage and batteries included, for example, Free API, Easy Database Migrations, Default Admin section, and more. I also use bootstrap to make it fast to build.
- As I make this project, everything is good and simple. I want to add a profile so it can use by everybody on their terms.
